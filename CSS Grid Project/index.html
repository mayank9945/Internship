        Technically unemployed, but spiritually a CEO of Nothing, Inc. I specialize in snack breaks, existential dread, and sending one résumé per week like a productivity god. Hustle culture fears me.

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.

          "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
          really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be
          able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
          developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
          attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
          people."

         Before joining the bootcamp, I had never written a single line of code—unless you count cheat codes in video games. I was completely clueless, like trying to fix a spaceship with a spoon. I desperately needed guidance from people who didn’t think Python was just a snake. A former student, who spoke about this program like it was Hogwarts for programmers, convinced me to join. And wow—they weren’t kidding! The instructors were so hands-on, I half expected them to start writing code on my forehead. The agile team project? Absolute madness—in a good way. It made me feel like I was hacking into the Matrix (legally, of course). I even talked about it in job interviews like it was my superhero origin story. Fast forward: I’m now a full-stack developer with multiple offers. Who knew going from ‘Hello World’ to ‘Hire me please’ would be this wild? 1000% recommend!
